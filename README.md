## Sequence Models for Automated Choreographic Notation Translation: BeneshED and BeneshFormer

This repository contains the source code for our Sequence Models: BeneshED (Encoder-Decoder) and BeneshFormer (Simple Transformer).

These models successfully achieve the desired automation of the task to convert ballet video pose data to Benesh Movement Notation.

The models are trained on the data found in the "Normalised" folder.
